# TwitchWordBridge
A simple twitch chat game where users have to come up with a word that starts and ends with randomly selected letters. 

To start the game, a user can use the command !wordbridge. Then, two letters will be randomly chosen. 
Users can then guess words by using the command !gw [word]. The first user that submits a word that works wins, and then the game state is over until another !wordbridge command is entered. 

This is what it looks like:
